# Day 3 Notes
The theme of the day was 'polygons', and I found some interesting bathymetry data from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources here: https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/water-lake-bathymetry.

This data was provided in Shapefile format, so I needed to convert it to GeoJSON and filter it for just Lake Minnetonka.

I also spent some more time learning about CSS and Javascript, specifically by building the color scale manually.
