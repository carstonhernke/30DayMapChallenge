# Day 4 Notes
The theme of the day was 'Green', and I decided to take this very literally and build a map which doesn't use latitude and longitude, but rather the RGB color system.

The 'color box' at the bottom was a bit of a struggle to put together, perhaps I will work on improving it in further weeks.
